# QAP-4-Files-TR
SD9 Semester1 QAP4

This repository contains 2 programs each in their own branches.

The One Stop Insurance Company program includes 4 files.  
I have included FormatValues.py because additional functions have been added. 
Reqiured imports are as follows:
import FormatValues as FV
import datetime
import time
from tqdm import tqdm

The Monthly Sales graphing program includes only the main.py file.
The only import required for this program is:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

All of these libraries should already be installed.  There is no need
to install any new libraries.
